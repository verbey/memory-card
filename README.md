# Memory card

A simple project to practice effects hook in React as well as other concept learned previously. Made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card)

Uses [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction) to fetch art works, [Catpuccin Macchiato Lavender](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) as its colour scheme and [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) for animations.
